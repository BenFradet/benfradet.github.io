title: Marseille <-> Fréjus bicycle tour

Last week, my partner and I went on a bicycle tour along the French Mediterranean coast. We started
from the West of Marseille where we live to join friends near Fréjus which is further along the
French Mediterranean coast to the East.

I'll first go over our bikes and the gear we packed and then I'll dig into the route we
took.

### Bikes

My partner is running a Giant Escape 2, it's her old commuter bike reused as a tourer. We're
currently looking for a replacement and more specifically a Trek Checkpoint ALR 5 which
will be way lighter (around 4kgs less) and better equipped, in particular with a Shimano
105 groupset.

I'm using a Ribble CGR SL with an Ultegra groupset geared as 36-52/11-34 which I found
suprisingly okay touring with our quite light setup, as we shall see.

### Gear

Let's go through each section in turn:

1. Tent: we're using an MSR Carbon Reflex 2 with a footprint which weighs around 1kg altogether
2. Sleeping gear: we're using Sea to Summit Spark SP1 sleeping bags which weigh 340gr each and Sea
to Summit Ultralight Air sleeping mats which weight 355gr each
3. Our reperation kit: with a couple of spare inner tubes and a tube repair kit, some eletrical
tape, a Crankbrothers M19 multi-tool, a MAM knife (which is truly excellent) and a hand pump.
Finally, we also had to pack a U-lock (if anyone has suggestions for a good lighter lock, I'm all
ears!).
4. Toiletries
5. First aid kit
6. Electronics: we have an X-Moove Solargo 15000mAh battery which is a cool solar battery (we
haven't put it through many cycles yet so I don't know what it's worth in the long run yet), an
e-reader and some cables. We also brought our phones which aren't pictured.
7. Clothes
8. Rain coats
9. Underwear and towels
10. Cycling clothes
11. Swimming gear

We didn't pack any cooking gear as we knew we'd be able to eat some place every night. Not pictured
though, is the large amount of snacks we brought along and of course, our drinks.

Additionally, it turned out we didn't need our rain coats or our sleeping bags for that matter as
we rode through a major heat wave in France (reaching more than 45°C in some places). More on that
later.

### Bags

My partner was using a Zéfal Z-Adventure F10 handle bar bag to carry the sleeping mats and bags and
our underwear.

I used a pair of Vaude Aqua rear panniers mounted on a Tubus Disco to carry well, all the rest!

We also carry a pair of Zéfal Magnum 1L bottles each for our drinks.

Finally, we each had a Vaude Carbo top tube bag to carry our smartphone and snacks.

All in all, my partner was carrying approximately 5kgs while I had around 18kgs of gear.

### Route

We usually tried to ride during the early hours of the day, with the ideal timeframe being between
5 and 10AM.

#### Day 1, Martigues -> La Ciotat

First day of our journey, taking us through Marseille and to La Ciotat, a beautiful city in the
[calanques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calanque) which invented
[pétanque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9tanque)!

We left a bit later than anticipated at around 6:20 and rode through the first leg of our journey to
the eastern part of Marseille where we stopped for a second breakfast in a bakery. This first part
was fairly easy as it's mostly flat and we know the road quite well.

The second part is a lot more difficult than the first as you follow the road around
[Mont Puget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Puget) which is quite hilly.

Unfortunately, when we started going down towards Cassis my partner got a flat tire. It turned out
she was carrying a piece of glass for some time which tore through her tire and ultimately her tube.
We stopped to quickly change tubes and headed towards Cassis to buy a new tire.

That wasn't the last of our trouble as the bike shop in Cassis was closed. After this small détour,
we decided to head directly to La Ciotat and find a new bike shop.

Luck took a turn for the better at this point, we didn't hit another flat despite the tear
in the tire for the 12 kms separating us from La Ciotat and we stumbled upon the excellent
[Cycles Lleba bikeshop](https://goo.gl/maps/g94qBSvByfVYCY8z9). The owner offered us an excellent
bargain: two Vittoria Zaffiro tires and two Conti Tour tubes for 40 euros!

After all these adventures, we reached our campsite at 11AM, had lunch, took a nap, swapped some
tires and enjoyed the sea!

Here's the bikemap for that first day:

#### Day 2, La Ciotat -> Hyères

The second day was quieter, less distance travelled and less elevation gain, taking us to family
members in Hyères continuing our journey eastward.

Compared to the previous day, it was fairly uneventful. We woke up at around 5AM, packed everything,
had breakfast, and we were on our way at 6.

The first leg to Toulon had some beatiful scenery as you go through the vineyards after
Saint-Cyr-sur-Mer and along the bay of Bandol as the sun comes up.

We stopped in Toulon to get a second breakfast at a bar and went back on our way. From Toulon to
Hyères we used the dedicated bicycle path which goes through most of the Var department (which is
known as "parcours cyclable du littoral" in French).

We reached our destination at around 9 and were able to enjoy a homemade couscous for lunch and a
nice view of the hippodrome (we obviously also took the obligatory nap on the beach in the
afternoon).

#### Day 3, Hyères -> Fréjus

Given that the heatwave mentioned earlier was starting and we had quite a few kilometers to do, we
decided to start earlier and left by 5AM. The goal for the day was to meet our friends near Fréjus.

We went back to the previous day's bicycle path and headed towards Bormes-les-Mimosas. The road
started to go uphill towards the Col de Gratteloup. However, this road is very narrow and very much
in use by all sorts of lorries which can block both ways given how tight the laces are. As a result,
I wouldn't recommend it when cycling. We'll see the alternative later in this post.

The road gets better going downhill as it is way larger and more beautiful. You find yourself
in a charming valley between two small mountains. Bonus, it becomes completely flat quite quickly
so you can really get the kilometers in.

We stopped for a quick second breakfast at La Môle headed back towards Fréjus. Once you reach
Port Grimaud, the road follows the Mediterranean until Fréjus.

We reached the campsite near Fréjus at around 10AM and it was already 31°C under shelter, I'll let
you imagine what it was like under the sun. We stopped for a couple of days for some well-deserved
rest enjoying the beaches under the shadows of palm trees.

During those two days of rest, we visited a few things and most notably the ruins of
[the Malpasset dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malpasset_Dam), one of the worst civil disaster
in France during the twentieth century. It was really humbling stuff.

#### day6

Unfortunately, we weren't able to do the scenery any justice because the roads were so small you
couldn't really stop to take pictures wihtout putting yourself in danger. There weren't any
shoulders when the landscapes were the most beautiful which is a shame! But believe me, the route
was truly amazing.

### Conclusion

This your was a preparation for our tour of Corsica which we'll do in September so stay
tuned for a new touring post!
