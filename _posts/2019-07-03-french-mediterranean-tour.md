Last week, my partner and I went on a bicycle tour along the French Mediterranean coast.

I'll first go over our bikes and the gear we packed and then I'll dig into the route we
took.

### Bikes

My partner is running a Giant Escape 2, it's her old commuter bike reused as a tourer. We're
currently looking for a replacement and more specifically a Trek Checkpoint ALR 5 which
will be way lighter (around 4kgs less) and better equipped, in particular with a Shimano
105 groupset.

I'm using a Ribble CGR SL with an Ultegra groupset geared as 36-52/11-34 which I found
suprisingly okay touring with our quite light setup, as we shall see.

### Gear

Let's go through each section in turn:

1. Tent: we're using an MSR Carbon Reflex 2 with a footprint which weighs around 1kg altogether
2. Sleeping gear: we're using Sea to Summit Spark SP1 sleeping bags which weigh 340gr each and Sea
to Summit Ultralight Air sleeping mats which weight 355gr each
3. Our reperation kit: with a couple of spare inner tubes and a tube repair kit, some eletrical
tape, a Crankbrothers M19 multi-tool, a MAM knife (which is truly excellent) and a hand pump.
Finally, we also had to pack a U-lock (if anyone has suggestions for a good lighter lock, I'm all
ears!).
4. Toiletries
5. First aid kit
6. Electronics: we have an X-Moove Solargo 15000mAh battery which is a cool solar battery (we
haven't put it through many cycles yet so I don't know what it's worth in the long run yet), an
e-reader and some cables. We also brought our phones which aren't pictured.
7. Clothes
8. Rain coats
9. Underwear and towels
10. Cycling clothes
11. Swimming gear

We didn't pack any cooking gear as we knew we'd be able to eat some place every night. Not pictured
though, is the large amount of snacks we brought along and of course, our drinks.

Additionally, it turned out we didn't need our rain coats or our sleeping bags for that matter as
we rode through a major heat wave in France (reaching more than 45°C in some places). More on that
later.

### Bags

My partner was using a Zéfal Z-Adventure F10 handle bar bag to carry the sleeping mats and bags and
our underwear.

I used a pair of Vaude Aqua rear panniers mounted on a Tubus Disco to carry well, all the rest!

We also carry a pair of Zéfal Magnum 1L bottles each for our drinks.

Finally, we each had a Vaude Carbo top tube bag to carry our smartphone and snacks.

All in all, my partner was carrying approximately 5kgs while I had around 18kgs of gear.

Unfortunately, we weren't able to do the scenery any justice because the roads were so small you
couldn't really stop to take pictures wihtout putting yourself in danger. There weren't any
shoulders when the landscapes were the most beautiful which is a shame!

### Conclusion

This your was a preparation for our tour of Corsica which we'll do in September so stay
tuned for a new touring post!
