For the past couple of years I've been working on and off on
[Dashing](https://github.com/BenFradet/dashing/graphs/contributors), it's a set of
dashboards to monitor an open source organization's health on GitHub.

At the moment, it mines historical data on GitHub regarding stars and pull requests.
Let's go through each dashboard!

### Dashboards

### Stack

### Conclusion

Future

Dashing was originally meant to be a toy project to try out
[Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) because I had never done any frontend development
before (as the project shows), there is a lot that can be improved in that regard.

As a result, I would gladly welcome any contributions on frontend-related improvements (of
course any improvement will still be definitely welcome!).
