For the past couple of years I've been working on and off on
[Dashing](https://github.com/BenFradet/dashing/graphs/contributors), it's a set of
dashboards to monitor an open source organization's health on GitHub.

At the moment, it mines historical data on GitHub regarding stars and pull requests.
Let's go through each dashboard!

### Dashboards

### Stack

### Running

### Conclusion

Of course, the set of dashboards is, at the moment, quite limited. Future dashboards
could include pull requests response and merge times and statistics around issues which
haven't been explored yet.

Dashing was originally meant to be a toy project to try out
[Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) because I had never done any frontend development
before (as the project shows), there is a lot that can be improved in that regard.

As a result, I would gladly welcome any contributions on frontend-related improvements (of
course any improvement will still be definitely welcome!).
