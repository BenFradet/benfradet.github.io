In this is post, I'll give a quick overview of the new features in the new
release of [RiotSharp](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp), the C# wrapper
for [the Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/).

### New Tournament API

In this release, we've added support to the new Tournament API which was
announced by Riot [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/announcements/show/72Ajd1An)
a month ago. Thanks to this addition, given that you've applied for a special
tournament API key, you'll be able to build a tournament system with the given
features:

  - Generate as many tournaments and tournament codes as you need
  - Automatic return of results to an HTTP endpoint of your choice, with
fail/retry error checking
  - Match results via the match endpoint, even though they are not ranked
  - Pre-game lobby events: who joined, who left, who switched teams and when
champ select, the loading screen, and the game itself begins


I'll give a quick rundown on how to do that:
