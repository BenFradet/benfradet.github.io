In this is post, I'll give a quick overview of the new features in the new
release of [RiotSharp](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp), the C# wrapper
for [the Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/).

### New Tournament API

In this release, we've added support to the new Tournament API which was
announced by Riot [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/discussion/announcements/show/72Ajd1An)
a month ago. Thanks to this addition, given that you've applied for a special
tournament API key, you'll be able to build a tournament system with the given
features:

  - Generate as many tournaments and tournament codes as you need
  - Automatic return of results to an HTTP endpoint of your choice, with
fail/retry error checking
  - Match results via the match endpoint, even though they are not ranked
  - Pre-game lobby events: who joined, who left, who switched teams and when
champ select, the loading screen, and the game itself begins


I'll give a quick rundown on how to do that.

First, you'll need a tournament API instance, which you can retrieve with the
tournament API key you got:
{% highlight c# %}
var tournamentApi = TournamentRiotApi.GetInstance("TOURNAMENT_API_KEY");
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you will have to create a provider given the region where the tournament
will take place and the url to an HTTP server listening on port 80 to which Riot
Games server will send callbacks containing information about completed games
create a tournament code you generated, more on that later:
{% highlight c# %}
var provider  = tournamentApi.CreateProvider(Region.euw, "http://mywebsite.com");
{% endhighlight %}

Thanks to this provider, which you should save if you want to create other
tournaments later on, you can create tournaments:
{% highlight c# %}
var tournament = tournamentApi.CreateTournament(provider.Id, "TOURNAMENT_NAME");
{% endhighlight %}

You can now generate tournament codes which can be used to join a game
with the specified settings:
{% highlight c# %}

{% endhighlight %}
