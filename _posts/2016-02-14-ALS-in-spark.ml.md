In this post, I'll show you how to use alternating least squares (ALS for short)
in [spark.ml](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html).

*Disclaimer: this post is mostly a copy/paste from
[a pull request](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10411) I wrote for Spark
documenting ALS and collaborative filtering in general in spark.ml.
Since the PR will likely be incorporated in the 2.0 release which is still a few
months away, I thought I'd share it.*
