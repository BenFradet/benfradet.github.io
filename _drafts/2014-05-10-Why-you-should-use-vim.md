While there is a somewhat steep learning curve to use vim at its full potential
I think it is one of the best if not the best text editor out there. What makes 
it really awesome are the plugins and the fact that you can develop your own. 
In this post, I am going to list the plugins I use to maximize my productivity 
and go over my .vimrc to give you a few ideas if you are planning on using vim.

###Plugins
The first thing you need is a plugin manager, there are two main alternatives:
  * [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim)
  * [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/)

This list is by no means exhaustive but should give you a good headstart.
