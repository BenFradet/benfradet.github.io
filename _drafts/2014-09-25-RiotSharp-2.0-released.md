We are pleased to announce the second version of
[RiotSharp](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp), the C# wrapper for
[the Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/). In this post, I will
detail the changes made to the wrapper.

### Tweak to the entry point of the wrapper

We have made a change to how you get a reference to the RiotApi. If you do not
own a production API key, you will have to proceed like so:

{% highlight c# %}
var api = RiotApi.GetInstance("yourApiKey");
{% endhighlight %}

However, if you own a production API key, you will have to specify your rate
limits:

{% highlight c# %}
var api = RiotApi.GetInstance("yourApiKey", "10sRateLimit", "10mRateLimit");
{% endhighlight %}

### Removals of the teams v2.2 and leagues v2.3 endpoints

Since it has been more than 2 months since the teams v2.2 and leagues v2.3
endpoints were deprecated, they have been disabled and consequently the methods
linked to those endpoints have been removed.

The concerned methods are:

  - `GetTeamsV22()`
  - `GetTeamsV22Async()`
  - `GetLeaguesV23()`
  - `GetLeaguesV23Async()`
  - `GetEntireLeaguesV23()`
  - `GetEntireLeaguesV23Async()`
  - `GetChallengerLeagueV23()`
  - `GetChallengerLeagueV23Async()`

### Deprecations of the teams v2.3 and leagues v2.4 endpoints

With the releases of the new teams v2.4 and leagues v2.5 endpoints the previous
endpoints were deprecated (teams v2.3 and leagues v2.4).

As a result a few methods were renamed:

  - `GetTeams()` was renamed to `GetTeamsV23()`
  - `GetTeamsAsync()` -> `GetTeamsV23Async()`
  - `GetLeagues()` -> `GetLeaguesV24()`
  - `GetLeaguesAsync()` -> `GetLeaguesV24Async()`
  - `GetEntireLeagues()` -> `GetEntireLeaguesV24()`
  - `GetEntireLeaguesAsync()` -> `GetEntireLeaguesV24Async()`
  - `GetChallengerLeague()` -> `GetChallengerLeagueV24()`
  - `GetChallengerLeagueAsync()` -> `GetChallengerLeagueV24Async()`

If you still want to use the deprecated endpoints, you will have to use those
methods.

### New teams v2.4 and leagues v2.5 endpoints

If you want access to those new endpoints, you will have to use the following
renewed methods:

  - `GetTeams()`
  - `GetTeamsAsync()`
  - `GetLeagues()`
  - `GetLeaguesAsync()`
  - `GetEntireLeagues()`
  - `GetEntireLeaguesAsync()`
  - `GetChallengerLeague()`
  - `GetChallengerLeagueAsync()`
