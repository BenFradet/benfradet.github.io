A quick post to announce the the next iteration of
[RiotSharp](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp), our C# wrapper for
[the Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/). As usual, I will list
the changes for this new version and what we are planning for 2.3.

### Modifications to the Match and MatchHistory endpoints

There were a few additions to the match and matchHistory endpoints, most
notably, you will be able to retrieve runes and masteries for a particular
participant of a match:

{% highlight c# %}
var api = RiotApi.GetInstance("yourApiKey");

var history = api.GetMatchHistory(Region.euw, 123456);
var runes = history[0].Participants[0].Runes;
var masteries = history[0].Participants[0].Runes;
{% endhighlight %}
